# ClimateWins
ClimateWins - Analyze climate change overtime with Machine Learning functions. Unsupervized Machine Learning example.

Due to the increase in extreme weather events, ClimateWins wanted to assess the tools availble to categorize and predict the weather in Europe. They want to know if Machine Learning is a suitable tool to use for this. The objective was to create a model that can predict the weather in the future and that can answer a set of key questions:

- How is Machine Learning used and is it applicable to weather data?
- What have max and min temperatures been historically?
- Are there any ethical concerns specific to usage Machine Learning with the suggested data?
- Can Machine Learning be used to predict weather a certain day and potential dangers arising from extreme weather conditions?

  Three methods are used and presented: The KNN method - K-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree and ANN - Artificial Neural Networks. The most suitable is chosen for analyzing Climate Change data.
