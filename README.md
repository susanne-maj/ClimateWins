## ClimateWins - Analyze climate change overtime with Machine Learning functions. Unsupervized Machine Learning example.

Due to the increase in extreme weather events, the non-profit organization ClimateWins wanted to assess the tools availble to categorize and predict the weather in Europe. They goal wast to find out if Machine Learning is a suitable tool to use for weather predictions and if yes, to create a model that can predict the weather in the future and that can answer a set of key questions:

- How is Machine Learning used and is it applicable to weather data?
- What have max and min temperatures been historically?
- Are there any ethical concerns specific to usage of Machine Learning with the suggested data?
- Can Machine Learning be used to predict weather a certain day and potential dangers arising from extreme weather conditions?

## Data 
- European Climate Assessment & Project data set.
- The data set includes weather observations from 18 different weather stations across Europe. The data is from late 1800s to 2022. Recordings are available for almost every day. Data regarding temperature, wind speed, snow,  global radiation amongst others were recorded. 

## Methods:

- Unsupervised Learning Algorithms: K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering and Principall Component Analysis (PCA). 
- Complex ML Models: Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). 
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Grid search and manual optimisation for model performance, analysis of hyperparameter impact on accuracy. 

## Tools used:
Python – data preprocessing, ML, and model evaluation
Jupyter Notebook – interactive development and visualisation
Pandas, NumPy – data manipulation and cleaning
Scikit-learn – clustering, PCA, random forests, and SVM
TensorFlow, Keras – building CNN, RNN, and GAN models
Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly – visualising trends, clusters, and predictions
